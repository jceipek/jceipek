### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Julian Ceipek

I â™¥ learning, collaborating & teaching.

I craft systems with & for people. Software thatâ€™s usable, extensible, [fast](https://jceipek.com/projects/making-faster-systems.html).

Over the past 8 years, I've designed, implemented, and maintained foundational systems for [approachable X-ray machines](https://jceipek.com/projects/x-ray-vision.html), [live](https://jceipek.com/projects/lynxtool.html) [programming](https://jceipek.com/projects/installation-visualizer.html) [environments](https://jceipek.com/projects/dark.html), [award-winning](https://jceipek.com/projects/tup.html) [multiplatform](https://jceipek.com/projects/vvr.html) [games](https://jceipek.com/projects/tendar.html), and [interactive](https://jceipek.com/projects/mesolite.html) [robotics](https://jceipek.com/projects/iridescence.html) [installations](https://jceipek.com/projects/returning-the-gaze.html).

I thrive in small collaborative teams that need versatility in the face of ambiguity.
